Completing his first two quests gives the player the ability to talk to him once every day to obtain a {{CraftReq|Colosseum Ticket}}. This is the second daily source of tickets after [[Typhoon]]. He will hold tickets for you for up to 3 days. Having more characters complete his quests does not provide more daily tickets.
