The Obol Alter offers three tabs for Obols and one summary page. In the first tab, Obols only affect the current character and slots are unlocked based on the level of the specific character. The second tab Obols affect all characters and slots are unlocked based on the total level of all characters. In the third tab you can reroll obol stats, combine obols and scrap obols to turn them into fragments. However, however the latter two features are not yet functional. In the fourth tab you can see the total bonuses from all your equipped obols.

To access the Obol Altar, one must defeat Amarok at least once and complete the quest "Bad Kitty, get off that altar!" on that character. The altar will become available to the remaining characters of that account.
