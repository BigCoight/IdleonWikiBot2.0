|notes=[[Krunk]] is found in [[Worlds#M2 - Freefall Caverns|Freefall Caverns]], the second zone of the mines, located at the bottom of the area.

Finishing his questline will unlock a shortcut to the gold ore within [[Worlds#M2 - Freefall Caverns|Freefall Caverns]], but only for characters that have completed the questline.

You must complete all three of his quests and talk to him after reaching [[Mining]] Level 25 in order to receive the {{CraftReq|Krunk Token}}, which falls on the ground. He does say Level 33 at first but then changes his mind and gives it to you early.
