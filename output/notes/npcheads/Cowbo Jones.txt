|notes=[[Cowbo Jones]] is on the righthand side of [[Worlds#D0 - YumYum Grotto|YumYum Grotto]], near the portal to [[Worlds#D2 - Jar Bridge|Jar Bridge]]. He facilitates the main questline in Yum-Yum Desert much the same way [[Scripticus]] does in Blunder Hills.

His quests introduce [[Alchemy]] and guide the player through the first half of the Desert. His final quest, "Oh No, not the Elderly!" isn't completable yet.
